Dependency Injection in Forth
----------------------------------------
Dependency Injection has become an increasingly popular
design pattern in languages like Java, Kotlin,
and C# by way of frameworks like Guice, Dagger, and Spring.
Although the pattern can be a frightening fount of complexity
if overused, when applied in moderation it can sometimes be useful.
We'll explore how this pattern can be expressed in Forth
and consider if a pattern usually applied in gigantic codebases
works at the scale of Forth.
