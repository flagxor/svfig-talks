Dividing ESP32forth
═══════════════════
   July 8, 2023

 ESP32forth is
🔥 TOO BIG! 🤬

What happened?

💡 Some OLED module
📷 ESP32-CAM ⇒ camera bindings
🦆 32-bit floating point
🥣 Serial and Serial2
🦷 Bluetooth Serial
🏢 Structures

📁 Files + SPIFFS
🧱 Blocks
⏰ Timers
🔌 Sockets
📶 WiFi
⛔ Fault Handling

🗎 Visual Editor
⚠ Interrupts
🅌 SD / SD_MMC Cards
⏧ I2C
✣ Heap management
❃ LEDC

Even more outside ESP32!
════════════════════════
🗔 Windows API bindings
 ╳ X11 API bindings
⌒  Graphics and Bezier curves
🧵 Threads

Root Causes
═══════════
☉ Different applications want
   different APIs / bindings
☉ It's easier to ship one big release
☉ It's easier to add than remove/refactor

How Big is too Big?
═══════════════════
☉ Should a Forth have DO..LOOP
   (or is FOR..NEXT enough) ?
☉ What about VALUE TO ?
☉ What about { locals } ?
☉ Structures ?
☉ Tasks ?
☉ Graphics ?

ESP32 Resources are Weird
═════════════════════════
☉ RAM is more scarce than Flash
   - So words defined in Forth are more expensive
   - So changable things are more expensive
☉ C Libraries can be huge (Bluetooth)
☉ Contiguous RAM varies by model

How to limit growth?
════════════════════
☉ Size of your ROM? (Jupiter ACE)
☉ What's in the standard? (Gforth)
☉ What limit? (Win32Forth)

What has helped?
════════════════
☉ Clearer hooks for expansion (userwords.h)
☉ People complaining it won't fit / build!
☉ Files for Linux + Windows

userwords.h
═══════════
int my_cool_function(char *foo, int bar, uint8_t *baz);
#define USER_WORDS \
  Y(MY_FUNC, n0 = my_cool_function(c2, n1, b0); NIPn(2)) \

Using Files more with ESP32forth?
═════════════════════════════════
☉ Many extensions are more about C libraries
☉ How to get things on/off the device?
   - ESP32forth isn't always on the network
   - putty etc. don't have X-Modem or the like
☉ I actually use files with SD card devices
   (e.g. ESP32-CAM)

A Stab in the Dark
══════════════════
☉ Break apart ESP32forth.ino
☉ Carve off less used modules placing them
   in the optional/ directory in the distribution zip
☉ Use __has_include("name.h") to load if moved
   next to ESP32forth.ino
☉ Iterate with the user community
   on which modules should be optional
☉ Maybe some should be optionally removable?

The Initial Optionals
═════════════════════
☉ assemblers.h - The assemblers for Xtensa + RISC-V
                  (not widely used/useful,
                   poorly documented/tested)
☉ camera.h - ESP32-CAM / OV2640
              (specific hardware,
               inaccurate detection of board)
☉ oled.h - Adafruit SSD1306 OLED support
            (specific hardware,
             not relevant to everyone)
☉ serial-bluetooth.h - Serial Bluetooth
                        + Bluetooth Terminal
                        (really big flash footprint)
☉ spi-flash.h - Low level SPI flash partition access
                 (not relevant to most users)

ESP32forth.zip
══════════════
ESP32forth/
  README.txt
  ESP32forth.ino
  optional/
    README-optional.txt
    assemblers.h
    camera.h
    oled.h
    serial-bluetooth.h
    spi-flash.h

Potential Future Candidates?
════════════════════════════
☉ LEDC support
☉ FreeRTOS Tasks
☉ GPIO interrupt triggers
☉ Timers
☉ RMT - Remote Control
☉ Sockets / Web Server
☉ Files / Block
☉ Editors
☉ I2C / Wire
☉ Floating Point

Discussion
══════════
☉ Are any of these a mistake?
☉ What else to leave out?
☉ Is there a good general principle?

QUESTIONS?
    😕
 Thank you!
