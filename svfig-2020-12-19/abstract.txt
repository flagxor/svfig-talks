Lisp-y Data Abstraction in Forth (now without leaks!)
-----------------------------------------------------
Back in Feb 2019, I explored how Forth can tackle SICP style data
abstraction over rational numbers, complex numbers, and polynomials.
However, in the interest of time, I left out the implementation of
a garbage collector (instead leaking like a sieve). I'll now correct
that omission, demonstrating a Cheney collector in Forth and how to
make closures that don't leak memory.
