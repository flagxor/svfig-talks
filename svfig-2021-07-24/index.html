FORTH 🐺
the LONE WOLF

FORTH IS POWERFUL
  🗲
• Compile Time Metaprogramming
• Domain Specific Languages

FORTH IS SUCCINCT
  🐞
: WASHER
   WASH SPIN RINSE SPIN ;

But FORTH can be CRYPTIC!
      🔮
: ch>stream ( ch st -- )
   dup wait-write
   >r r@ >write @ r@ >offset c!
   r@ >write @ 1+ r@ @ mod r> >write ! ;

How can we program
 Forth together?

Do we want to?

More Hands aren't
   Always Good!

WHY THEN?
            🐑🐑🐑🐑
• Sometimes you're programming
  with YOURSELF from years ago
• We use words because
  we hope to connect!
• Help Forth play in a complex world

FOCUS ON TWO GAPS
   🙤
• Modularity
• Data Abstraction

MODULARITY
    🙤
• Be explicit about interfaces
• Limit how much has to be
  understood at once
• Limit the effects of change

THINKING FORTH:
      🙤
"But Forth extends the concepts of modularity
 and information-hiding further than any other
 contemporary language. Forth even hides
 the manner in which words are invoked and
 the way local arguments are passed."

How to make a Module?

PROBLEMS
   🙤
• Internals can't call externals
• Externals are shared with everyone

( What if this is INTERNAL )
: pover   p> p> dup >r >p >p r> ;
( But this is EXTERNAL )
: 2pdup   pover pover ;

N+1th MODULE SYSTEM
   🙤
• Python like import syntax
• Explicit out of order exports
• Two wordlists per module
• Share instances of an import

modules.fs

: >wordlist ( xt wid -- )
   get-current >r set-current execute r> set-current ;

     only forth wordlist >order definitions ( new wordlist )
     2r> 2dup 2>r included

ELEMENTS OF PROGRAMMING
   🙤
• Primitive Expressions
  - the simplest entities
    the language is concerned with
• Means of Combination
  - how compound elements are built
    from simpler ones
• Means of Abstraction
  - how compound elements can be
    named and manipulated as units
————————————————————————————————————————————
https://mitpress.mit.edu/sites/default
  /files/sicp/full-text/sicp/book/node5.html

MEANS OF DATA COMBINATION
   🙤
• In conventions languages structures and arrays
  - Structures are feasible in Forth, but unidiomatic
  - Arrays in Forth are untyped
• This is a weak spot in Forth's typical usage
  - You can easily define strings,
    but not so easily fuse 2 of them into
    a First+Last name "thing".
  - You can make a stack and a string,
    but this doesn't naturally create a stack of strings.

MEANS OF DATA ABSTRACTION
   🙤
• CREATE DOES> is the closest mechanism in Forth
  - But it dispatches only a single operation.

OBJECT ORIENTED LEXICONS
   🙤
• SWOOP or other OO lexicons "solve" Forth's weak
  data combination and abstraction,
  but at the cost of a "C++/Java in Forth" style.
• OO puts data first, which usually requires naming
  that data. Forth wants data hidden/implicit:
  : WASHER
     WASH SPIN RINSE SPIN ;

CLASS POINT
  VARIABLE X
  VARIABLE Y
  : SHOW ( -- )   X @ . Y @ . ;
  : DOT ( -- )   ." Point at " SHOW ;
END-CLASS
———————————————————————————————————————————————

POINT BUILDS ORIGIN
5 ORIGIN X !
8 ORIGIN Y !
ORIGIN DOT
———————————————————————————————————————————————
http://soton.mpeforth.com/flag/swoop/index.html

0 VALUE FOO            \ Contains pointer to instance
POINT NEW TO FOO       \ Construct instance of class POINT
8 FOO USING POINT X !  \ Store data in X
99 FOO USING POINT Y ! \ Store data in Y
FOO USING POINT DOT    \ Display X and Y
FOO DESTROY  0 TO FOO  \ Release space
———————————————————————————————————————————————

DATA GENERALIZATION
   🙤
• Naturalistic Forth relies on
  implict scope/context
• When data needs to generalize,
  this best happens by introducing
  abstraction of that context

APPROACHES TO GENERALIZATION
   🙤
• Singleton - UPDATE, PAD
• Additional Stacks - Graphics Context
  • Implicit Stack - String stack
  • Explicit Stack - Graphics Context
• Named - VOCABULARY, USE
• References - OPEN-FILE, ALLOCATE

IMPLICIT STACK
   🙤
$" foo" $" bar" $+ $.

EXPLICIT STACK

: box ( n -- )
   4 0 do
     dup fd 90 rt
   loop ;

save-pen
  100 100 moveto
  10 box
  200 200 moveto
  10 box
restore-pen

NAMED
  🙤
screen 10 box
printer 10 box

REFERENCES
  🙤
• Passed around on stack
• Remeber to release it!

EASY TRANSITIONS
   🙤
Singleton → Stack
Singleton → Named

HARD TRANSITIONS
   🙤
Singleton → References
  • Update all callers
  • Manage lifetime

How to avoid References?

s" source.txt" R/O OPEN-FILE
READ-COMPLEX-DATA
CLOSE-FILE

s" source.txt" R/O OPEN-FILE infile
s" dest.txt" W/O OPEN-FILE outfile
infile READ-COMPLEX-DATA
outfile WRITE-COMPLEX-DATA
infile CLOSE-FILE
outfile CLOSE-FILE

s" source.txt" R/O OPEN-FILE
  s" dest.txt" W/O OPEN-FILE
    READ-COMPLEX-DATA FILE-SWAP
    WRITE-COMPLEX-DATA
  CLOSE-FILE

TODO
* Generics

OTHER LANGUAGES
   🙤
• Classes - AbstractSproketFactory
• Generics - Map<String, Widget>
• Dependency Injection
  • Guice
  • Dagger
